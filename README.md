Krime Video â€” Amazon Prime Video Clone
ðŸš€ Project Overview
This is a pixel-perfect frontend clone of Amazon Prime Video, rebranded as Krime Video ðŸŽ¬. Built purely with raw HTML & CSS, this project focuses on layout replication, responsiveness, and UI consistency to sharpen frontend skills and practice responsive design techniques.

Features
Fully responsive design that adapts smoothly to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)

Clean, modern UI inspired by Amazon Prime Videoâ€™s homepage

CSS Grid and Flexbox used for layout structuring

No JavaScript â€” all interaction and layout achieved with HTML and CSS

Hosted live on GitHub Pages for easy access and demo

Why This Project?
I wanted to refresh my web development flow after a heavy DSA and college grind. Building close-to-real UI replicas like this one taught me where to draw the line between pixel-perfect design and practical development, especially respecting copyright boundaries. Also, itâ€™s a fun way to get back into frontend basics before diving into React.

Whatâ€™s Next?
Planning to extend this project with React components and state management, while balancing ongoing DSA practice.
